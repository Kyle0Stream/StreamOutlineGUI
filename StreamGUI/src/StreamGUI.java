 * 
 *  Things to get from the image (e.g. DSCN001.JPG or DSCN001.PNG) itself:  
 *      - image width, image height
 *      - locations of the four corners of the square (in pixels)
 * 
 * Things to get from the user:
 *      - Which corners are which: label ABCD the red(?) corners of the square
 *      - Horizontal Field of View (HFOV) of the camera that took the pictures.
 *        (we think our red/silver cameras are either 67.5 or 69.5 or something,
 *         but we need our software to work for all cameras).
 * 
 *      - Real-world length of each side of the square (e.g. 8)
 * 
 * Then, either:
 *      A) create a text file (e.g. DSCN001.input.txt) with all the info.
 *         and run the MatLab program that will do the actual conversion
 *   or B) we should translate the MatLab program into Java, and actually do
 *        the math needed to "rectify" the perspective of the image
 * 
 * Eventually, we may want a program (probably a separate program?) for merging
 * multiple rectified images. We'll deal with that later.
